Description:
This project offers access to the complete historical data of worldwide daily average rates for the top 100 traded cryptocurrencies
sorted by market capitalization according to http://www.coinmarketcap.com (hereinafter: the website).

It  utilizes both original scraping techniques and a public API to collect its data.

Usage:
The project is operated as follows:

Run "python ms1.py" with either one more of the following arguments:

  -h                Show this help message and exit
  -cdict            Create dictionary file
  -udict            Update dictionary file
  -udb password DB  Update mysql DB


By default, the script searches for the file 'dfs_dict.p' in the project's directory and reads it to a dictionary variable.

In case the file is not present, or needs an update in your perspective, use -cdict/-udict respectively.
To create\update the mysql database, use -udict (it does both).

*** Be aware that every creation of the dictionary takes ~15 minutes to complete due to limited requests per minute the website allows.

enjoy!
