Description:
This project offers access to complete historical data of worldwide daily average rates for the top 100 traded
crypto currencies sorted by market capitalization according to http://www.coinmarketcap.com (hereinafter: the website).

It utilizes both original scraping techniques and a public API to collect data.

The project is operated as follows:

Run "python ms1.py" with either of the following arguments:

  -cdict, --cdict   Create dictionary file
  -capi, --capi     Create api file
  -udict, --udict   Update dictionary file
  -udb password db  Update mysql db


By default, the script searches for the files 'dfs_dict.p' and 'api_data.p' in the project's directory and them to
variables. Due to the limitations imposed by the sleep intervals, the time it takes to create the files is the same as
the time it would take to update them. Thus, if you wish to update the api dataframe or the scraped data dictionary to
the latest date, you must recreate them using -capi or -cdict.

In case the top 100 currencies list in the website changed, you can use -udict to add new coins to the dictionary
without overwriting existing ones. However, if you then wish to bring the entire dictionary uo to date,  you must
nevertheless use -cdict again, in which case only the 100 currencies presently featured on the list will be inserted.

To create or update the mysql database, use -udb (it does both). In case you updated\recreated the pickle files,
there's no need to create a new db. The script will look for missing dates\coins and update teh existing one accordingly

* Be aware that every creation of the dictionary\api file takes ~15 minutes to complete due to limited requests
per minutes allowed by the website.

Enjoy!
